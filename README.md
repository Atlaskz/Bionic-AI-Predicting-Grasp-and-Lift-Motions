# Bionic AI: Predicting Grasp and Lift Motions

## Intorduction

This project is inspired by recent research done on the use of AI in contorlling the movements of prosthetics. Naturally generated electric signals from the patient's muscles (EMG) or brain (EEG) can be used to predict the movement they intend to perform. The optimization of end to end prosthetic devices will be a great leap forward in human-machine symbiosis.

The data for this project comes from a [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/grasp-and-lift-eeg-detection/data).
